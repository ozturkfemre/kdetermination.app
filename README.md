## k determination app

In this project, I turned the [optimal k project](https://github.com/ozturkfemre/optimal_k), which I previously shared as a repository, into a Shiny dashboard. In this dashboard, you can find the cluster number recommendations of Average Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn Index methods for 9 real data sets.
